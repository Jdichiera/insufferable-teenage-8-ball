# insufferable-teenage-8-ball

Your traditional magic 8 ball imagined as an insufferable teenager.

## Usage

Think of a question you would like to ask the Magic 8-Ball and then run the Javascript application. The Magic 8-Ball will consider your question and then deliver your answer.

## How it works

The 'magic' answer is derived by selecting one random value from each of three collections, then concatenating them together for the final message.

## Development

This project was developed in Javascript using Visual Studio Code. Source control was handled by Git and GitHub.

### Note: Not all teenagers are insufferable - many can be quite pleasant.
